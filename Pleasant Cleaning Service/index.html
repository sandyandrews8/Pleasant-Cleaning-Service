    <p><strong>How can I make a payment?</strong> <br> ‣ We accept cash, checks, and Venmo! Please see the payment tab to learn more. </p>
    <p><strong>What can I do to prepare for the cleaning?</strong> <br> ‣ In bedrooms, we would really appreciate it if clothes and any toys are picked up from the floor. That way, we are able to easily access the floor for vaccumming and can avoid unnecessarily touching your personal items. Also, it would be great is there were no dirty dishes around the kitchen. If you have dogs, we would recommend temporarily putting them away for their safety. </p>
    <p><strong>What are your hours of operation?</strong> <br> ‣ We typically work every weekday from 7am to 5pm. Appointments generally fall within this time. We do not work on major holidays such as New Year's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. </p>
    <p><strong>How have you been operating during the pandemic?</strong> <br> ‣ We do everything in our power to be safe when we provide cleaning services. We always use masks and regularly swap out our gloves to avoid the transmission of germs. It is up to clients whether or not they would like to wear masks in our presence. Of course, since it is their house, they may do whatever they please and we will respect their decision. We ask that if anyone in your house experiences COVID-19 symptoms to please notify us so we can postpone your appointment. </p>
